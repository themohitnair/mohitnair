        <p class="text-xl text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
          I'm a passionate software developer with a single purpose - to create
          things. I love building - and the language I build in just so happens
          to be Computer Science.
        </p>
        <p class="text-xl text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mt-4">
          When I'm not creating, you can find me playing chess, cooking food,
          watching movies, writing, or ricing my Arch Linux setup (I use Arch,
          by the way). I'm always eager to learn new technologies and take on
          challenging projects.
