        <p class="text-xl text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
          I'm a passionate software developer with a focus on creating elegant,
          efficient solutions to complex problems. With a strong foundation in
          both frontend and backend technologies, I enjoy building applications
          that are not only functional but also provide an exceptional user
          experience.
        </p>
        <p class="text-xl text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mt-4">
          When I'm not coding, you can find me playing chess, hiking in the
          mountains, or reading a good book. I'm always eager to learn new
          technologies and take on challenging projects.
